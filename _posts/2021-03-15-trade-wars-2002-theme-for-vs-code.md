## Package and publish your very own VS Code theme

Ever since I got addicted to playing Trade Wars 2002 on the BBS's when I was twelve years old, I've loved the color scheme. 
There are only twelve colors, if you don't count black and white; half that many, if you don't count the "bright" colors as separate. 
Trade Wars 2002 used those colors in appealing combinations, often by showing complementary colors together, like magenta with green, cyan with red, and yellow with blue.

Here are the colours, including black and white:

Here's a shot of my VS Code instance, with my Trade Wars 2002 theme applied, as I write this blog:

Although I published the colour theme, it's not really finished. I want to replace the white and grey with something else, and some of my choices are too low-contrast, making them hard to work with.
