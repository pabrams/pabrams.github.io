The node-gyp package is notoriously troublesome as a dependency for people trying to build the dependent package. 

It's often built as a post-install step, for reasons that were explained to me more than once, but my eyes glazed over both times. Something to do with C++? Shrug. 
Anyway, you'll inoccently invoke `npm install`, and after all the packages download, the post-install script will gag and spit this wall of errors at you.

If you're like me, you might troubleshoot it for a while, and fall down a rabbit hole leading to a vast maze of python versions, suggestions to set various PATH values, and a slew of other suggestions, most of which will not help you. Or, if you're lucky, one of them will happen to help, on a fluke.
  
The real problem is probably that you're not using the correct version of node-gyp and/or node.
 
The answer turns out to be in the issue template on the node-gyp github repository. If you start a new issue over there, you'll see this instead of a blank issue:
 <!--
Thank you for reporting an issue!

Remember, this issue tracker is for reporting issues ONLY with node-gyp.

If you have an issue installing a specific module, please file an issue on
that module's issue tracker (`npm issues modulename`). Open issue here only if
you are sure this is an issue with node-gyp, not with the module you are
trying to build.

Fill out the form below. We probably won't investigate an issue that does not
provide the basic information we require.

-->

Please look thru your error log for the string `gyp info using node-gyp@` and if the version number is less than the [current release of node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases) then __please upgrade__ using the instructions at https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md and try your command again.

Requests for help with [`node-sass` are very common](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues?q=label%3A%22Node+Sass+--%3E+Dart+Sass%22). Please be aware that this package is deprecated, you should seek alternatives and avoid opening new issues about it here.

* **Node Version**: <!-- `node -v` and `npm -v` -->
* **Platform**: <!-- `uname -a` (UNIX), or `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" /C:"System Type"` (Windows) -->
* **Compiler**: <!-- `cc -v` (UNIX) or `msbuild /version & cl` (Windows) -->
* **Module**: <!-- what you tried to build/install -->

<details><summary>Verbose output (from npm or node-gyp):</summary>

```
Paste your log here, between the backticks. It can be:
  - npm --verbose output,
  - or contents of npm-debug.log,
  - or output of node-gyp rebuild --verbose.
Include the command you were trying to run.

This should look like this:

>npm --verbose
npm info it worked if it ends with ok
npm verb cli [
npm verb cli   'C:\\...\\node\\13.9.0\\x64\\node.exe',
npm verb cli   'C:\\...\\node\\13.9.0\\x64\\node_modules\\npm\\bin\\npm-cli.js',
npm verb cli   '--verbose'
npm verb cli ]
npm info using npm@6.13.7
npm info using node@v13.9.0

Usage: npm <command>
(...)
```

 I have npm version 9 installed. Since there is no fix listed for that version, I tried the fix for the 7/8 versions:
 
`sudo npm explore npm/node_modules/@npmcli/run-script -g -- npm_config_global=false npm install node-gyp@latest`
