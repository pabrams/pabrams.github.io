The node-gyp package is notoriously troublesome as a dependency for people trying to build the dependent package. 

It's often built as a post-install step, for reasons that were explained to me more than once, but my eyes glazed over both times. Something to do with C++? Shrug. 
Anyway, you'll inoccently invoke `npm install`, and after all the packages download, the post-install script will gag and spit this wall of errors at you.
