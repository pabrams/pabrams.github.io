Ever since I got addicted to playing Trade Wars 2002 on the BBS's when I was twelve years old, I've loved the color scheme. 
There are only sixteen colors, or something like that; half that many, if you don't count the "bright" cdolors as separate. 
Trade Wars managed to use those colors in very appealing combinations, often by mixing complementary colors together. 

Here are 14 of the colors; I feel like I'm forgetting a couple, but I can't think which they are.
